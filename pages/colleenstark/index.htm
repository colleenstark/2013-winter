	<p> 	Colleen Stark is a student studying photography at Ryerson University, in Toronto. Originally from a small town in southern Ontario, she consistently takes the aesthetics of her hometown and applies it to her work. Because of her many travels she finds it beneficial to apply her cultural experiences in her work as well. She is a hard-working, organized, and open-minded individual who will emerge with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 2016 in hopes of pursuing an artistic career. Not only is she studying photography, she has also worked for various families doing weddings and portraits (human and pet). She enjoys creating conceptual pieces that make the viewer think and generate their own interpretations, as well as dabbling in different types of photographic genres. </p>
